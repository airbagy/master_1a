# Exercise 1

## Scenario 1

No, I don't think this is a ideal problem for linear regression. Because we are
more interested in "whether" (the probability) that a customer makes a purchase,
this is more of a classification problem. Ideally the output of this model
should be a probability score between 0 and 1 (indicating the probability that
the customer will make a purchase), instead of an estimation for quantity. As
all regression models predicts a quantity and the estimation does not
necessarily lays between 0 and 1, this scenario is not ideal for linear
regression.

However, if we rephrase the question to "predict a customer's total spending",
this problem becomes more suitable for linear regression and can solved using
the same data. We can perform a linear regression regarding times of visits and
total length of stay as variables and the output as the total spending (0 if 
nothing is purchased).

## Scenario 2

The dependent variable is 'child_inc30' and the potential independent variables
are 'parents_inc50', 'child_gender' and 'child_edu'. We do not include the
education level of the parents ('father_edu' and 'mother_edu') as they seems to
have less affect on the child's salary. Assume the independent variables we
chose are $x_1, x_2, x_3$ with their coefficients being $\beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3$
respectively, we make the assumption that $y = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{3} \beta_i x_i + \epsilon$
where $\epsilon \sim Normal(0, \sigma)$. In other words, controlling for the
child's gender and education level, his/her income should have a linear
relation to the parents' income at 50.

Beyond the simple linear model (with only the parents' income as independent
variable), we could include the other variables like suggested above. Moreover,
we could include the interaction terms between 'parents_inc50' and 'child_gender',
or between 'parents_inc50' and 'child_edu'. These would help understand the main
relationship as including them can help understand and control the affects other
variables have on the child's income.

## Scenario 3

No, this is not a good candidate for a linear regression model.

There are too few variables collected other than salary. Many other factors (for
example age, marital status, health, stress...) may have a significant
influence on the employee's happiness rating, but those factors are not included
in the data. Therefore, I suspect that we can draw a reliable conclusion from
a simple linear model. Not controlling for the other factors may give us
misleading results.

The happiness score presented in the data is highly biased as they are
self-evaluated or self-measured scores. Without a reliable quantitative dependent
variable, a linear model might not be suitable.

I also suspect that the happiness one receives from salary has diminishing
returns, meaning the more money we get, the less we benefits from the same 
increment in salary. As the relationship is far from linear, I believe a
linear model can not be used in this case.
